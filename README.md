# Plant Village Disease Prediction System
This project is designed to predict plant diseases based on images using deep learning techniques. The workflow is divided into the following steps:

# 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Data Collection: Gather a dataset of plant leaf images representing various diseases.
Image Preprocessing: Perform necessary preprocessing on the images, such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
# 2. Data Splitting and Preparation
Data Separation: Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
Train Generator: Prepare the training data generator.
Test Generator: Prepare the testing data generator.
Validation Generator: Prepare the validation data generator.
Parameter Tuning: Set up parameters for training, such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs.
# 3. Model Training
Model Selection: Use the ResNet50 model with a Global Average Pooling 2D layer to train on the image data.
Training Process: Train the model using the prepared generators and optimize the performance.
# 4. Model Evaluation
Accuracy & Loss Visualization: Visualize the model's accuracy and loss over the training epochs to assess performance.
# 5. Prediction
Testing: Use the trained model to predict disease labels on the test dataset.
# 6. Deployment
Streamlit Application: Deploy the trained model as a web application using Streamlit, allowing users to upload images and get predictions on plant diseases.
